The following Haskell code attempts to implement a function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. However, it contains a subtle error related to pattern matching and the handling of the base case. 
```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```
This code will work correctly for non-negative integers. However, if you try to call `factorial` with a negative number, it will cause a stack overflow because the recursion will never reach the base case (0).
